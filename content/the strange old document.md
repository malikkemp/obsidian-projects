[[David Halloway]] receives an envelop in the mail with no information on it. No return address, and no postmark. The paper feels aged, as if it's been sitting for years. When he opens it, it is a handwritten note. After reading the letter, he can **ignore it**, or decide to **dig deeper**.

#### **The Letter**
_"The steps still echo, Halloway. They never stopped. Follow them, and you will hear what they want you to hear. But be warned: not all footsteps lead back."_
The writing is shaky, as if the writer had a sense of **urgency** when writing it. The paper has a yellowish tint, yet is crisp, showing signs of age.

#### **Photograph**
A **faded photograph** of Redhaven could be included, showing a **mysterious figure standing near the lake** where Emily died, facing away. This figure is **blurred** and indistinct, yet the **footprints in the snow** are clearâ€”leading away from the lake and towards [[RedHaven]]. In the background, the **town looks abandoned**, with windows boarded up, and the once-vibrant streets now dark and quiet. On the back of the Photograph in short, bold writing is "_They Never Left... Can you see them?_".
