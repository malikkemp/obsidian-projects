### **1. Nora Collins - The Skeptical Survivor**

**Background**:  
Nora Collins is one of the few residents of Redhaven who **remembers the town before the experiment**. She was a teacher in Redhaven’s local school and lived there her whole life. After the experiment caused the rift, she found herself caught in a **time loop**—living the same day over and over again, unable to escape. She remembers bits and pieces of the past and is deeply frustrated by the **gaps in her memory**, as she tries to piece together what happened.

**Role in the Story**:  
Nora serves as a **critical eyewitness** who can help David understand the town’s history and the lives of its people before the experiment. She doesn’t trust the authorities and believes the **government covered up the truth**. She’s **skeptical of the supernatural**, but the rift has opened her eyes to things that can’t be explained away. She has spent years trying to break the cycle of time, but every time she seems to find a way out, she finds herself **back in the same place**.

**Personality**:  
Nora is strong-willed and fiercely independent. She’s **not easily fooled**, and she doesn’t take kindly to people telling her what to believe. Her skepticism and pragmatic approach make her a valuable ally for David, though her doubts about supernatural explanations often put her at odds with others in the town who’ve become deeply paranoid or obsessed with the rift.

### **2. Thomas Beckett - The Haunted Fisherman**

**Background**:  
Thomas Beckett was once a simple fisherman who lived on the outskirts of Redhaven, on the shores of the lake where Emily Halloway died. Before the experiment, he had a peaceful life. But since the rift occurred, Thomas has become **withdrawn**, and many believe he’s gone insane. He often speaks of **strange occurrences**—his encounters with figures from the past and future who appear to him near the lake.

**Role in the Story**:  
Thomas is one of the few people in the town who has **direct contact with the rift**. He is inexplicably tied to the events of the town, with many believing that he’s either **a witness to what happened** or has been **possessed** by the rift’s influence. He’s an enigmatic figure who might hold the answers to the mysteries surrounding Emily’s death, and his cryptic words may help David make sense of the **temporal anomalies**. The fisherman’s connection to the lake could lead David to an unsettling discovery about the **true nature of the rift**.

**Personality**:  
Thomas is melancholic and haunted, often slipping between lucid moments and rambling incoherence. He doesn’t trust others and avoids contact with the townspeople as much as possible. His deep connection to the lake and its strange happenings make him a **key witness**, but his **psychological state** could either make him a valuable ally or an unreliable source of information.

### **3. Mary Ellis - The Distorted Witness**

**Background**:  
Mary Ellis was the **mayor’s wife** before the incident in Redhaven. After the rift occurred, she started experiencing **distorted memories**—at times, she swears that she’s reliving her past, but something is off. Events seem familiar but aren’t quite right. Some days, she thinks it’s the year **1968**; other days, she believes it’s still **the day of the experiment**.

**Role in the Story**:  
Mary is a tragic figure—her **mental state has deteriorated** as the rift messed with her sense of time. Her **visions** and fractured memories may help David understand the **psychological toll** the rift has taken on the town’s residents. She might hold keys to the **mystery of Emily’s death**, as her fragmented memories occasionally blur the lines between past and present. David may need to carefully navigate her confusion to pull out important clues.

**Personality**:  
Mary is often confused and anxious, and she’s haunted by the loss of her husband, who was one of the first to disappear after the rift. Despite her confusion, she is still **kind-hearted** and **compassionate**. However, her distorted reality makes her a difficult person to rely on for concrete information, though her **fragments of truth** can still be vital.

### **4. Samuel Cooper - The Paranoid Investigator**

**Background**:  
Samuel Cooper is a local detective who was born and raised in Redhaven. Before the experiment, he was a well-respected member of the community, but after the strange occurrences began, his career and life began to unravel. His obsession with **tracking down the truth** behind the rift has turned him into a paranoid figure. He’s **convinced that there are still people in the town hiding the truth**, possibly even members of the government or military. He’s become increasingly **isolated**, constantly shadowing the other townsfolk, suspicious of everyone.

**Role in the Story**:  
Samuel is a **valuable ally** for David, as he has spent years **investigating the experiment** and is deeply committed to finding answers. However, his obsession with **exposing hidden conspiracies** often leads him to misinterpret information or become overly suspicious of others. He might provide key insights into the **federal involvement** in Redhaven’s disappearance, but David will need to navigate his **paranoia** to get to the heart of the truth.

**Personality**:  
Samuel is highly intelligent but also **cynical and distrustful** of others. He’s **skeptical of anyone** who claims to know the full story, but at the same time, he’s willing to work with David if it means uncovering the truth. His drive for justice can be admirable, but it’s also tinged with a **desperation** that might cloud his judgment at times.

### **5. Eleanor Grey - The Timeless Mother**

**Background**:  
Eleanor Grey is a deeply religious woman who was once married to a local man who worked as a **doctor** in Redhaven. After the rift occurred, Eleanor became **obsessed with the idea of redemption**. She believes that the town’s fate was caused by the collective **sins** of its people, and she now believes that everyone must undergo a form of **atonement** before they can escape the temporal distortion.

Her family is one of the few that hasn’t been affected by the rift in the same way as others, which only strengthens her belief in the need for a **spiritual awakening**. She often holds **sermons** for the townspeople, preaching about the need to reconcile with their past and confront the rift in a **spiritual context**.

**Role in the Story**:  
Eleanor is an important **moral compass** in Redhaven. Her view on the experiment and the town’s fate gives David a different perspective on the rift. Her spirituality might lead David to uncover clues related to the **temporal anomalies**—specifically **the connection between time and the afterlife**, a theme that may open up a new layer to the mystery.

**Personality**:  
Eleanor is deeply empathetic, but her **zealous faith** sometimes makes her rigid in her thinking. She is compassionate and caring, but she’s also **fixated on the idea** that the rift is a **divine punishment**. David may find her a source of **comfort**, but also someone who might lead him into confusing theological debates about the nature of time and fate.

### **6. Jacob Willis - The Mad Genius**

**Background**:  
Jacob Willis is the town’s eccentric mechanic, known for his obsession with **inventing** and **building strange contraptions**. Before the rift, Jacob was the quiet genius who loved tinkering with gadgets, and his workshop was a popular place for the local children to visit. However, since the rift occurred, he has become **completely obsessed** with time and its manipulation. He believes the town is stuck in a **time prison**, and that only by **reversing the rift** can anyone escape. Jacob’s strange theories about time and machines make him a **key figure** in the search for answers.

**Role in the Story**:  
Jacob might hold the secret to **repairing the rift**. He’s built several machines, each more complex than the last, trying to reverse the effects of the temporal anomaly. While David will find Jacob’s theories to be **eccentric** and **hard to follow**, there may be merit in his strange ideas. Jacob’s inventions might also provide key pieces of **technological insight** that David can use in his investigation.

**Personality**:  
Jacob is **eccentric** and sometimes seems unhinged. He talks in **abstract concepts** and can be difficult to follow. Despite his quirks, he’s a deeply **kind and gentle soul**, and his **determination** to solve the mystery of the rift can be a valuable asset for David—if he can ever figure out how to translate Jacob’s genius into something actionable.
