### **The Shadowpeople – The Ones Between Realms**

The **Shadowpeople** are spectral entities that exist in the liminal space between life and death, reality and nightmare. They are the remnants of those who have been consumed by **RedHaven**, forever trapped in a state of neither existence nor non-existence. These beings flicker between worlds, their presence felt more than seen—whispers in the wind, silhouettes in the dark, reflections that move on their own.

#### **Origins of the Shadowpeople**

RedHaven wasn’t always a ghost town. It was once a thriving mining community, but something—**an event no one survived to describe**—warped it beyond recognition. Those who vanished in that event did not die in the traditional sense. Instead, their souls were **shattered, fragmented across dimensions**, unable to pass on, unable to return. They became something in between: The Shadowpeople.

#### **Nature and Behavior**

- **Unseen, but Always Watching:** The Shadowpeople exist just outside of perception. They manifest as fleeting movements at the edge of vision, lingering figures in the fog, and distorted reflections in broken glass. They do not fully belong to this world, nor do they belong to the next.
- **Echoes of the Lost:** When the town **claims** someone, they do not merely die—they become part of it. The Shadowpeople are those who failed to escape, their minds eroded by the void, leaving behind nothing but instinct and fragments of memories.
- **Mimics of the Dead:** They are known to **imitate the voices and faces of the lost**, drawing people deeper into the town’s madness. Some believe they are merely puppets of RedHaven, while others think they are trying to warn outsiders before they too are taken.
- **Bound by the Town:** They cannot leave RedHaven. If someone tries to run, the Shadowpeople will always find a way to lead them back.

#### **How They Manifest to David**

- **Emily’s Shadow:** David sometimes sees Emily in the periphery of his vision—her reflection in a window, her voice in the static of his recorder. But is it really her, or is it RedHaven using his grief against him?
- **The Figures in the Fog:** As David explores, he will see humanoid shapes standing in the mist, unmoving. The moment he looks away, they shift, drawing closer.
- **The Hollow Whispers:** The deeper David ventures into RedHaven, the more he hears **his own thoughts spoken back to him**—only slightly wrong, slightly distorted. The town is listening. The Shadowpeople are responding.

#### **What Do the Shadowpeople Want?**

It’s unclear if they have a will of their own or if they are merely puppets of something greater. Some seem **hostile**, trying to pull David into the void. Others appear **remorseful**, as if trying to communicate some terrible secret. The truth? They are **both**—remnants of humanity twisted by the town’s hunger.

One thing is certain: **They do not want to be alone.**
