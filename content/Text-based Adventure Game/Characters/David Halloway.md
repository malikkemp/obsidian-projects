David Halloway is an investigative journalist who is used to dealing with **strange and unexplained phenomena**. He’s never been a skeptic, but he’s not exactly a **believer** in the supernatural either—he’s someone who thrives on uncovering **the truth behind mysteries**. However, lately, his **personal life** has been unraveling, pushing him into the realm of **desperation**.

#### **Why Is David Here?**

1. **A Failed Career:** David’s career as a journalist had been **floundering for a while**, as he struggled to get meaningful stories that would make a difference. Over the past couple of years, his work has felt more like chasing ghosts than uncovering any real truths. A string of **unresolved cases & an anonymous tip** has led him to [[Redhaven]]—a town that’s been **off the radar for decades** after its mysterious disappearance.

2. **The Redhaven Files:** He’s heard about **Redhaven** from a **mysterious tip** from an anonymous source;  [[the strange old document]] David receives leads him to learn more about the **disappearance of the entire town**. This very likely relates to [[Emily Halloway#**Emily's Death**|Emily's Death]]

3. **A Personal Loss:** On top of his career woes, David has been coping with **the recent death of his pregnant wife**, [[Emily Halloway|Emily]], which has pushed him further into isolation. His grief has made him **question everything**, and part of him is still searching for **closure**, even if that means uncovering something truly horrifying. [[RedHaven]] seemed like the perfect place to bury his fears and frustrations, a distraction maybe—he thought it might be a **quiet, isolated escape** where he could work out his personal issues. Emily’s death was **sudden and strange**, and David couldn’t help but feel like there was something more to it. Was it just an accident? Or was there something **out of his control**? That question has haunted him for months.

#### **David’s Emotional Journey:**

4. **The Grief:** David is filled with **regret** over Emily’s death. He was away working on another case when she passed, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was never **present enough** for her in the end.
5. **The Guilt:** Deep down, he’s convinced he could have **prevented something**—either by being there more for Emily or by preventing the **terrible event in [[RedHaven]]**. His motivation is wrapped up in trying to make sense of his **personal loss** as well as the **mysteries surrounding Redhaven**.
6. **A Need for Closure:** The deeper David digs into the mystery of Redhaven, the more he starts to believe that **the disappearance of the town might be tied to his wife’s death**—as if they were both **victims of the same twisted force**. This thought, though irrational, begins to pull him deeper into the town’s sinister pull.
