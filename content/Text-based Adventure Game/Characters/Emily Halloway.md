#### **Emily's Death**
Emily died 6 month's prior to the events of **The Last Transmission**. Emily’s death was ruled an **accidental drowning**, but there were **odd circumstances** surrounding it. She was found in a nearby lake, with no clear reason as to why she had been there alone, and no sign of a struggle. Her car was parked a mile away from the water, seemingly **abandoned**, and there were strange **footprints** around the lake’s edge that didn’t make sense.


#### **David's Guilt**
David had been away during her death, investigating the [[Lucy Chen Disappearing]]. The fact that she died in such an inexplicable manner, with **no answers**, fills David with frustration and guilt. Was there something that he missed? Was there something that the police missed? Why didn't he push harder to understand what was happening in their lives before she passed? The lake, the **footprints**, and the strange circumstances around her death hints at something supernatural and perhaps is linked to [[RedHaven]]

#### **The Lake**
The lake is close to RedHaven but not located in it.
