### **Setting**

- **Place:** A mountainous, snow-covered ghost town cut off from civilization.
- **Time:** Time Loop

### **Lead Character**

- **Name:** [[David Halloway]]
    
- **Background:**  
    David Halloway is an investigative journalist who has a knack for dealing with strange and unexplained phenomena. Though he isn’t a skeptic, he isn’t quite a believer in the supernatural either—he thrives on uncovering the truth behind mysteries. However, lately, his personal life has been unraveling, pushing him into the realm of desperation.
    
    **Why Is David Here?**
    
    1. **A Failed Career:** David’s career as a journalist has been floundering for a while, as he struggled to get meaningful stories. His work has felt more like chasing ghosts than uncovering any real truths. After a string of unresolved cases and an anonymous tip, he found himself in [[Redhaven]], a town that had been off the radar for decades following its mysterious disappearance.
    2. **The Redhaven Files:** David received a strange document from an anonymous source, which led him to delve into the disappearance of Redhaven. This likely connects to the mysterious circumstances surrounding [[Emily Halloway#**Emily's Death**|Emily's Death]].
    3. **A Personal Loss:** On top of his career woes, David has been coping with the recent death of his pregnant wife, [[Emily Halloway|Emily]]. Her sudden and strange passing pushed him further into isolation. He’s questioning everything and is still searching for closure, even if that means uncovering something truly horrifying. Redhaven seemed like the perfect place to bury his fears and frustrations—a distraction. David thought it might be a quiet, isolated escape where he could work out his personal issues. However, Emily’s death haunts him. Was it just an accident? Or was there something more out of his control?
    
    **David’s Emotional Journey:**
    
    1. **The Grief:** David feels deep regret over Emily’s death. He was away working on another case when she passed, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was never present enough for her in the end.
    2. **The Guilt:** He’s convinced that he could have prevented something—either by being there more for Emily or by preventing the terrible events in [[RedHaven]]. His guilt intertwines with his quest for meaning in both his personal loss and the town's mysteries.
    3. **A Need for Closure:** The more David delves into Redhaven’s mystery, the more he starts to believe that the disappearance of the town might be tied to his wife’s death—suggesting they were both victims of the same twisted force. Although this thought seems irrational, it pulls him deeper into the sinister mystery.
